## Diffusion Project

This project is a custom-built diffusion model, implemented from scratch to generate images using the One Piece and MNIST datasets. The primary goal was to gain a thorough understanding of diffusion models by diving deep into the underlying mathematics and coding each component manually.

Overview

	•	Objective: To explore and understand diffusion models by implementing one from scratch, with an emphasis on image generation and the mathematical foundations of the diffusion process.
	•	Datasets: One Piece and MNIST, used to test and visualize the model’s capabilities.
	•	Approach: Built each stage of the diffusion pipeline step-by-step, from noise addition to image denoising and reconstruction.

This project serves as both an exploration of diffusion model theory and a practical implementation for generating images.
